Stretch:

1. Using arrays and the random method, can you simulate the lottery number generator, selecting six numbers in the range 1 to 49? No duplicates!

2. Using the random method, a loop and the Scan methods, create a number guessing game. Use appropriate prompts:
"Do you want to guess another number? (y/n)"
"What is your guess?"
"That is too high."
"That is too low."
"Well done, you guessed correctly."
"That took [n] guesses."
Thank you for playing.
